# AI Agent Coordination for Planning Travel Itineraries

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
This project demonstrates **multi-agent orchestration** for end-to-end journey planning.  
A **Main Orchestrator Agent** receives natural language input from the user, extracts trip details, and delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents to complete different components of the request.

## ðŸ¤– Agents
- **Flight Ticket Agent**  
  Retrieves ticket information and flight alternatives.  

- **Accommodation Agent**  
  Locates and manages reservations for lodging (hotels, rentals, etc.).  

- **Itinerary Agent**  
  Creates a comprehensive daily itinerary for the journey.  

## ðŸ”„ Workflow
1. The user enters travel information in plain language (destination, dates, preferences).  
2. The **Main Orchestrator Agent** parses the request.  
3. Flight, lodging, and itinerary arrangements are gathered by calling upon the relevant sub-agents.  
4. Outputs are combined into a **full structured itinerary**.  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Status
